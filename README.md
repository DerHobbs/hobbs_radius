# hobbs_radius

This script dynamically adjusts the culling radius for players in RedM based on the number of players nearby. The culling radius determines the distance at which game entities are rendered or processed. When more players are around (30 or more), the script reduces the culling radius to improve performance. Conversely, with fewer players nearby, it increases the radius for a richer environment. This balance helps optimize server performance while maintaining gameplay quality.
